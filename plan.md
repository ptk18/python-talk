migration 

current nlp pipeline is backend/app/nlp_v2/

want to migrate this to nlp_poc_honest.py as nlp_v3/

do not remove or overwrite current backend/app/nlp_v2/, just leave the folder as it is 

create nlp_v3/ which is nlp_poc_honest.py but with necessary steps so that it can work well with current bakend apis from backend/ dir and frontend/ dir
