I want to refactor the current system's frontend/ with new-frontend/ and keeping the same logic and keeping all the apis of the backend/

keep the nlp and voice system the same too. I only want to change the UI desgin

can have a few adjustments if the core features of the current systems have while new frontend doesn't have that features, adjust the new frontend to have those features

analyze dirs first and write the implementation plan first 

keep all apis working with the new frontend with the same functionality as current version

don't put emojis, unnecessary comments and extra print lines in the code
