# Todo
I want to inspect the system's Text to Speech modules
Right now it is desinged to offer 2 options (broswer TTS and Google Speech TTS)
User can choose either of these options in settings
I want to make sure when user choose one of this option it should work for throughout the system every page. 
And I want pytalk to give seamless user experience, so the role of smooth TTS is one of the important parts, for the whole user journey I want pytalk to be friendly AI voice agent (the vibe of coding with their friend or friendly assistant) so the whole user journey after logging in from home page to every app, we should have greeting or responsding sentences so that TTS can read (speak to user).
What ever mode (broswer TTS and Google Speech TTS) user choose, it should be work exceptionally too.
