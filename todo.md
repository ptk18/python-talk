# Todo
- now History tab is to create new conversation for codespace page
- I was a misunderstanding 
- actually that conversation creation should be in home page and it is not conversation creation (starting from now we will use it as new app creation)
- in home page above app cards, we should have file upload box and give the app name, it is basically we create a new app
- how about + button or "new app" button and when user click, a dialog box is shown and ask user for 
1) app name (text field)
2) app type (radio button): import or upload
if "import" -> give drop down box of supported python libraries that user can chose (now we will only show turtle)
if "upload" -> let user upload a python file and create a new app (previously it was a new conversation)
